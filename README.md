# Code-Quiz
I created a code quiz to help beginners with their knoweldge of coding. The goal is to complete the quiz as fast and as accurately as possible.

Once the quiz begins, a timer counts down from 100. For each question the user gets wrong, five seconds are subtracted from the time. When the quiz is finished, the time left becomes the user's score. The user inputs their initials which is then saved along with their score in the previous score section which is viewed upon submitting and can also be vievwed by clicking on the self-titled button at the top left page of the screen.

An alert is also triggered if the timer gets to zero, either by getting too many questions wrong or by taking too long to complete the quiz.
